Drupal Admin Scripts
====================

This is a personal collection of scripts useful in managing a Drupal installation. You are free to use the scripts here however you wish; however please bear in mind that I am not at the moment maintaining them with a view to general use, so don\'t expect too much in the way of backwards compatibility and so on.

Each script has more information on what it does as comments in the header.
